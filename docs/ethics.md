\# Ethical Considerations



\## Bias and Fairness

\- \*\*Data Bias\*\*: Congress data skewed (e.g., more D/R bills); mitigated by balanced class weights, stratified sampling.

\- \*\*Model Bias\*\*: Party/policy encoding checked for neutrality; calibration reduces overconfidence.

\- \*\*Fairness Audit\*\*: CV scores show consistent performance across parties (e.g., similar AUC for D/R sponsors).

\- \*\*Mitigation\*\*: Adaptive thresholds; no demographic features used.



\## Transparency and Explainability

\- Predictions include confidence intervals and feature importance.

\- Open-source code/models for audit.

\- Dashboard explains: "Predictions based on historical patterns; not guarantees."



\## Privacy and Data Use

\- Uses public API data only; no user data collected.

\- Ethical Sourcing: Compliant with Congress.gov terms.



\## Potential Misuse and Safeguards

\- \*\*Misuse Risk\*\*: Over-reliance on predictions for advocacy; mitigated by uncertainty displays and disclaimers.

\- \*\*Societal Impact\*\*: Positive – increases transparency; negative – could discourage low-probability bills (note: "Focus on building support").

\- \*\*Accessibility\*\*: Free/open; plain language summaries..



\## Broader Impact

\- Promotes civic participation, especially in underrepresented communities.

\- Future: Bias monitoring dashboard.
